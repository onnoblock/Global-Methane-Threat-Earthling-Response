# Global-Methane-Threat-Earthling-Response
A civic, ethically grounded, and signage-ready response to the global methane crisis—equipping Earthlings with protocols, dashboards, and youth-trainable tools to detect, capture, and transform methane into comfort, fuel, and legacy.

# 🌍 The Global Threat of Methane — and What We Should Do as Earthlings

This repository is a signage-ready, spiritually grounded, and youth-trainable response to the global methane crisis. It is designed for civic stewards, barangay leaders, youth volunteers, and local governments who seek to transform methane from a climate threat into a fuel asset and a legacy of comfort.

## 🧭 Purpose

- Identify methane hotspots in air, water, and land
- Equip small operators and LGUs to capture, purify, and reuse methane
- Provide signage-ready protocols, QR-linked dashboards, and youth co-signature sheets
- Promote ethical stewardship, intergenerational comfort, and civic transparency

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Fork this repo and localize the signage-ready protocols for your barangay or LGU.
2. Train youth and civic volunteers using the `training/` modules.
3. Deploy methane detection and capture tools listed in `tools/`.

5. Share your gratitude and legacy reflections in `gratitude/`.

## 🕊️ Stewardship Ethos

> “To capture what harms, and return it as comfort—this is the work of Earthlings.”

This project is spiritually grounded in the belief that every emission avoided, every youth trained, and every comfort restored is a form of civic worship and intergenerational love.
