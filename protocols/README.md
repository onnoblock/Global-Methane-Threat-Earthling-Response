# 🛢️ Signage-Ready Protocol: Methane Capture from Authorized Landfills

## Purpose
To capture methane emissions from landfills and convert them into usable fuel, while ensuring civic transparency and youth-verifiable stewardship.

## Steps

1. **Install Gas Collection System (GCS)**
   - Vertical wells spaced 30m apart
   - Connected to vacuum blowers and sealed piping

2. **Purify the Gas**
   - Use activated carbon filters or membrane separation
   - Achieve ≥95% methane purity

3. **Store and Resell**
   - Compress into high-pressure cylinders
   - Label with QR-linked fill logs and safety sheets

4. **Log and Display**
   - Update methane logs weekly
   - Post signage-ready dashboards at landfill gates
   - Enable youth co-signature sheets and gratitude boards

## Safety
- Equip staff with methane detectors and PPE
- Conduct monthly leak audits
- Train youth in emergency response

## Spiritual Note
> “Even decay can be redeemed. Let every captured breath be a comfort returned.”
